[Changelog](https://github.com/tigerbeetle-rust/tigerbeetle-unofficial/blob/v0.10.1%2B0.16.34/CHANGELOG.md)

Unofficial [TigerBeetle] bindings for [Rust].

> **WARNING**: In [TigerBeetle] a client is **not [backward compatible][2]** with a cluster. You cannot run a newer client against an older cluster: clients are only [forward compatible][3] with replicas from their own version or newer (see the ["Oldest supported client version"](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/releases/tag/0.16.34) for the supported versions range).  
> To avoid accidental use of a newer [TigerBeetle] client with an older cluster, it's highly recommended to pin the exact version if this crate in your `[dependencies]` and only change it with the cluster upgrade along:
> ```toml
> [dependencies]
> tigerbeetle-unofficial = "=0.10.1+0.16.34"
> ```




## Status

Because this [TigerBeetle] client library implementation is not a part of the [official `tigerbeetle` repos][1], it is hard to ensure and keep some of [Rust] safety guarantees from the outside. For that reason I invite people to contribute to this repo or finally develop the official [Rust] client library.
